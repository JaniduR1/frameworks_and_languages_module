Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### Simple Routing

Falcon's routing system is straightforward, permitting the easy mapping of URLs to sources. This characteristic simplifies the development and upkeep of the web application(s).
`falcon_server/server.py`
```python
app = falcon.App()
app.add_route('/item', PostItem()) # POST Endpoint
app.add_route('/items', GetItems()) # Get All Items

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with make_server('', 8000, app) as httpd:
        print('Serving on port 8000...')

        # Serve until process is killed
        httpd.serve_forever()
```
This feature addresses the complexity of internet routing, offering a clear and concise way to define routes. It also advantages developers by decreasing boilerplate code and enhancing the clarity of the application.
